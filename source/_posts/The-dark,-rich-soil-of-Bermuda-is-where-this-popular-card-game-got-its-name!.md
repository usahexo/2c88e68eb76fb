#  The dark, rich soil of Bermuda is where this popular card game got its name!

Bermuda Triangle is a popular card game that can be played with two or more players. The object of the game is to remove all of the cards from your hand. The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. Aces are high and deuces are low.

The player who removes the last card from their hand wins the game. In case of a tie, the player with the highest card in their hand wins.

To start the game, each player is dealt 10 cards, face down. The next card is turned over to begin the discard pile and the remaining cards are placed face down in a stack next to it, forming the stock pile.

The player who turns over the first card starts the game. They place one card face up on top of the discard pile and then take another card from the stock pile and place it face down beside the first card.

The player to their left then takes a turn. They can either pick up the top card from either pile or they can take both piles into their hand and end their turn. If they choose to take both piles, they place one card from each onto the discard pile and take another card from the stock pile to replace them. play then passes to the left again.

The only time you can not pick up a card is if you have five cards in your hand (a run). When this happens, you must draw two cards from either Stock or Discard Pile which will give you six cards total; then place one of these new cards FACE DOWN on Discard Pile 

 Player must continue taking turns until someone has no cards left in their hand; at which point that person automatically loses, regardless as to whether or not their opponent still has any playable cards remaining 

 Winning: The player who removes all of their playing cards first - WINS!
