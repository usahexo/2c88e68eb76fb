#  Bipartisan Bill Aims to Legalize Sports Gambling in Florida

On Tuesday, a bipartisan bill was introduced in the Florida state legislature that would legalize sports gambling in the state.

The bill, filed by State Senators Stephen Wise (R) and Randolph Bracy (D), would allow gambling on professional and college sports at licensed casinos, racetracks, and other venues. It would also authorize the Florida Gaming Commission to regulate sports betting.

"This is about consumer choice and expanding opportunities for Floridians to enjoy legal gaming," said Wise in a statement. "It's also about creating jobs and bringing much-needed revenue to our state."

Gambling on sports is currently illegal in Florida, with limited exceptions for fantasy sports. The proposed bill would allow people to bet on games both in person and online.

If passed, the bill would generate an estimated $236 million in annual revenue for the state, according to a study by the Spectrum Gaming Group. That money could be used to fund education, infrastructure projects, and other priorities.

Other states have recently moved to legalize sports gambling, including New Jersey, West Virginia, and Rhode Island. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on the legality of such gambling later this year.

#  Key Figures in Florida Politics Bet on Gambling Legislation

Florida is a key state in gambling legislation, with a population of over 20 million and a thriving tourist industry. The current political landscape has a number of key figures who are likely to play important roles in any gambling legislation that moves forward.

On the pro-gambling side is State Senator Bill Galvano, who is expected to play a leading role in any gambling bill. He has been a vocal supporter of expanding gambling in the state, and has the backing of many powerful lobbying groups.

Another key figure is State Representative Jose Felix Diaz, who also supports expanded gambling. He has been a key negotiator on gambling bills in the past, and is expected to take a lead role on any potential legislation this year.

On the anti-gambling side is State Senator Dennis Baxley, who has been a vocal opponent of expanding gaming in Florida. He is backed by powerful religious groups that oppose gambling, and he has been a major roadblock to past efforts to expand gaming in the state.

There are also a number of other key players who could play an important role in any gambling legislation. These include Governor Rick Scott, who has remained mum on the issue but could still veto any pro-gambling bill that reaches his desk; and House Speaker Richard Corcoran, who has yet to take a position on the issue but could be crucial in getting any gambling bill through the House.

With so many key players involved, it remains to be seen how the debate over gambling plays out in Florida this year. But one thing is clear: there is plenty at stake for everyone involved as lawmakers make their final bets on what kind of gambling legislation will pass.

#  Debate Over Sports Betting Heats Up in the Sunshine State

For years, the debate over legalizing sports betting has been a hot topic in the Sunshine State. But with a new governor in office, it appears that the debate is heating up once again.

Governor Ron DeSantis has made it clear that he supports legalizing sports betting in Florida. This comes as no surprise, given that he has previously voiced his support for the idea.

But not everyone is on board with this idea. Some lawmakers argue that legalizing sports betting could lead to increased gambling addiction rates and other social ills. They also argue that it would be difficult to regulate such a system.

Others, however, argue that sports betting is already happening illegally and that legalization would bring much-needed revenue to the state. They also point out that it would create jobs and help boost tourism.

So far, there has been no movement on the issue in the Florida legislature. But with Governor DeSantis pushing for action, it is likely that we will see some movement on this issue in the near future.

#  Florida Legislature Mulls over Gambling Expansion

Florida gambling officials and legislators continue to explore ways to expand gambling in the state in order to bring in new revenue. The state currently has a limited number of casinos, racetracks with slot machines, and bingo halls, but lawmakers are looking at other types of gaming that could be brought into the state.

One proposal being discussed is for the state to allow poker rooms. This would allow people to play poker for real money in establishments that are licensed and regulated by the state. Another proposal being discussed is for the state to allow fantasy sports leagues. These leagues would allow people to bet on the outcomes of simulated sporting events, and the winners would collect payouts based on their picks.

Officials are also exploring the possibility of allowing casino gambling in resort areas like Orlando and Miami. This would give people who visit these areas an opportunity to gamble without having to travel to Las Vegas or Atlantic City. In addition, officials are considering allowing slot machines at airports and racetracks throughout the state.

The Florida Legislature is expected to debate these proposals in the coming months. If they decide to pass any of them, they will then need to be approved by voters in a statewide referendum.

#  Legalization of Sports Gambling Appears Likely in Florida

The legalization of sports gambling in the state of Florida appears inevitable, as lawmakers and casino operators alike continue to signal their support for the move.

In February, 2018, the state Senate voted unanimously in favor of a measure that would legalize sports betting in Florida, and while the House has yet to take up the issue, there is strong indication that they will do so soon.

Casino operators are also in favor of legalization, as it would provide a new revenue stream for them. Seminole Gaming CEO Tony Sanchez said earlier this year that his company would be eager to offer sports betting if it is legalized in Florida.

“We are looking forward to the possibility of offering sports betting if it becomes legal in Florida. It would be another amenity we could offer our guests to enhance their experience while at our properties,” Sanchez said.

It’s not just casino operators who are hoping for legalization; law enforcement officials are also on board. In a letter addressed to state lawmakers, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw and leaders from six other counties urged legislators to legalize sports betting, arguing that it would help reduce illegal gambling activity.

“Allowing regulated sports betting at casinos and racetracks will provide much-needed revenue for our local communities, while reducing – and hopefully eliminating – illegal bookmaking operations which have negative consequences for public safety and tax revenues,” the letter read.

If legalized, sports gambling in Florida would likely be operated by the state’s existing casinos and race tracks. The Daytona Beach News-Journal reports that at least three casinos – including the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Hollywood – are already making preparations to offer betting on sporting events.[1]
