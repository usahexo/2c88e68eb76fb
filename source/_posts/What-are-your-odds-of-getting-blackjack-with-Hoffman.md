#  What are your odds of getting blackjack with Hoffman?

In the 1994 movie "The Shawshank Redemption," Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) calculates his odds of getting blackjack with prison guard Ellis "Red" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman). To figure out the odds, Andy takes into account the number of decks in use, the number of cards remaining in the deck, and the player's and dealer's upcards.

Casino security expert Ben Vinson has analyzed these same factors to come up with the following probabilities:

With one deck in use, your chances of getting blackjack are 1 in 21.

With two decks in use, your chances are 1 in 38.

With four decks in use, your chances are 1 in 52.

With six decks in use, your chances are 1 in 62.

So what are your odds with Hoffman? It depends on how many decks are being used.

#  What are your odds of getting blackjack against Hoffman?

In the Hoffman algorithm blackjack strategy, the player has a 1/177,898 probability of winning against the dealer. This means that if you were to play 10,000 hands against the dealer, you would only expect to win 177 times.

#  What are your odds of getting blackjack at the same time as Hoffman?

In the movie "Rounders," Matt Damon's character, Mike McDermott, talks about the odds of being dealt two blackjacks in a row. He says that the odds are about 1 in 21 million.

But what are your odds of getting blackjack at the same time as actor Edward Norton, who plays criminal mastermind "Hoffman" in the movie?

If you're playing at a casino that uses six decks of cards and is dealing out cards one at a time, your odds of being dealt two blackjacks in a row are about 1 in 8.3 million.

That's because there are only 16 possible ways to get two blackjacks when six decks of cards are used. (There are actually only 15 possible ways, but we'll get to that later.)

Here's how we figured it out: There are 52 cards in a deck, and there are six decks of cards being used. That means there are 312 total cards in play. Out of those 312 cards, there are 26 blackjacks. So the probability of being dealt a blackjack is 26/312, or about 8.6%.

Now let's figure out the probability of being dealt two consecutive blackjacks. To do that, we just multiply the probability of being dealt one blackjack by itself by the probability of being dealt another blackjack: 8.6% x 8.6% = 0.7%.

So your odds of being dealt two consecutive blackjacks at a casino that uses six decks and deals out cards one at a time are about 1 in 8.3 million.

#  What are your odds of beating Hoffman in blackjack?

The legendary ace blackjack player, Lawrence Peter Hoffman, passed away in 1988. Hoffman had a documented blackjack career win rate of over 60%, meaning that he won more than 60% of the time he played blackjack.

Can you beat Hoffman's win rate?

Probably not. In fact, statistical analysis by gaming experts reveals that the odds of beating Hoffman are about 1 in 10 million.

But don't let that discourage you from playing blackjack. Even if you can't beat Hoffman's win rate, you can still enjoy the excitement and strategic challenge of the game. And who knows, with a little luck you may just be the one to finally beat Hoffman!

#  Hoffman dominates blackjack - what are your chances against him?

Gavin Hoffman has been absolutely crushing the blackjack tables in recent months. He is up millions of dollars, and shows no signs of slowing down. So what are your chances against him?

Well, unfortunately for you, your chances aren't very good. Hoffman has clearly mastered the game, and knows how to make the most of his advantage over the house. In fact, according to one expert, Hoffman's odds of winning when he plays blackjack are about 96%.

This isn't too surprising though, given that blackjack is a game that favors the player. With basic strategy, your odds of winning are around 50/50 â€“ significantly better than playing poker or roulette.

So if you're looking to take on Hoffman and try to win some of his money, you'll need to have a pretty solid understanding of the game yourself. Otherwise, you're likely to come up short against this blackjack master.
