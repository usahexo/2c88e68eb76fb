#  You Have to be 21 to Play Casino Banker Dice Bull-Bull Game

Casino Banker Dice Bull-Bull is a game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages, but in order to play the banker, you must be 21 years old or older. The object of the game is to roll the dice and accumulate as many points as possible. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

To begin, each player is given three dice. They will then take turns rolling the dice. The player must keep all three dice on the table in front of them at all times. They cannot move them around or stack them on top of one another. After the player has rolled their three dice, they can either set them down and take another turn, or they can choose to keep rolling until they do not want to roll any more. If the player rolls all sixes on their first roll, they automatically lose and are out of the game.

If the player rolls doubles on their first roll, they can either set them down and take another turn or keep rolling until they do not want to roll any more. If they choose to keep rolling and get doubles again, they automatically lose and are out of the game. 

The player’s score for that particular roll is equal to the total number shown on all three dice. For example, if a player rolls a two, a four and a six, their score for that particular roll would be 18 (2 + 4 + 6). If they then rolled a one and a five on their next roll, their new score would be 21 (1 + 5 + 15). The player continues rolling until they either set their dice down or lose by rolling all sixes or doubles twice in a row.

The first player to reach 100 points or more wins the game.

#  Older Gamblers Get Their Chance to Win at Casino Banker Dice Bull-Bull Game

In the banker dice bull-bull game, the object of the game is to roll two six-sided dice and achieve a total score that is as close to 21 as possible, but not exceeding 21. Aces are worth 1 point, 2s through 6s are worth face value, and a 7 or 11 scores automatically (natural). If you roll an 8, 9, 10, you must choose either to take another card or stand. The player’s turn is over when he has either decided to take another card or stand on the total of his two dice rolls.

The banker always stands on totals of 17 or more. In this game variation, the banker wins all ties. The game can be played with two players or with a group of people. With more than two players, each person gets their own turn to roll the dice.

To begin the game, each player places an agreed upon wager in the pot. The player who is rolling the dice is called the shooter. The shooter rolls both dice and attempts to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If they go over 21 (or “bust”), they lose their bet. If they hit 21 on the first roll (a “natural”), they automatically win double their bet amount. After each player has had one turn (two rolls of the dice), the player with the highest total score wins the pot. If there is a tie, then those players share the pot equally.
