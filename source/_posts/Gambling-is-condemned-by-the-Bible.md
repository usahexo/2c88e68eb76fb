#  Gambling is condemned by the Bible

The Bible condemns gambling in no uncertain terms. Gambling is associated with greed, covetousness, and other sinful attitudes and behaviors. It also creates a false sense of security and can lead to financial ruin.

Gamblers often rationalize their behavior by saying that they are just taking a chance, but the Bible says that gambling is foolishness. “Fools throw away their money on games of chance; they don’t realize that they are ruining themselves” (Proverbs 13:11).

Gambling can also lead to addiction and other destructive behaviors. “People who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction” (1 Timothy 6:9).

Those who gamble are defying God’s will for their lives. The Bible says, “Do not let your heart be drawn away from God…Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil” (Ephesians 5:5-7).

Gambling is a waste of time and money, and it can lead to great harm. If you have a problem with gambling, please get help from a qualified professional.

#  The Bible forbids gambling

The Bible forbids gambling in a number of passages, including Exodus 22:17, Leviticus 19:13, Deuteronomy 23:19-20, and 1 Corinthians 6:9-10. In Exodus 22:17, God says, "You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's." Coveting means to want something that belongs to someone else. The idea behind this commandment is that we should be content with what we have and not desire what belongs to others.

In Leviticus 19:13, God says, "You shall not cheat your neighbor nor rob him. The wages of a hired worker are to be paid before the sun sets." This passage forbids stealing from others. Gambling involves taking money from someone else in order to gamble it away. So it is forbidden by this passage from Leviticus.

In Deuteronomy 23:19-20, God says, "Do not keep the wages of a wicked man overnight until morning. Take them immediately lest he cries out against you to the Lord and you become guilty of sin. Do not oppress an immigrant worker or hire him at a wage lower than you would pay a native worker." This passage forbids cheating people out of their wages. Gambling often involves paying more for a chance to win money than the amount actually at stake. So it falls under the prohibition against cheating people out of their rightful wages.

Finally, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 says, "Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God." This passage makes it clear that engaging in any kind of sinful behavior will exclude someone from inheriting the Kingdom of God. Gambling is included in this list of sins because it is often associated with greediness and greed is one of the seven deadly sins listed there.

#  The Bible says that gambling is a sin

Gambling, the act of playing games of chance for stakes, is considered a sin by many religious groups. The Bible specifically condemns gambling in Deuteronomy (28:30-34).

Those who gamble often do so with the hope of winning big money. But as the Bible says, "the Lottery is a fool's game" (Proverbs 16:33). Gambling not only wastes money, it also risks ruining relationships and causing financial hardship.

The Bible teaches that we should use our money wisely and not gamble it away. Instead, we should put our trust in God, who will provide for us if we obey his commands.

#  Gambling is never justified according to the Bible

Gambling is never justified, according to the Bible. The Bible opposes gambling in both the Old and New Testaments.

The book of Proverbs specifically condemns gambling: “Whoever pleases the Lord shall be rewarded with riches, with honor, and with long life” (Proverbs 22:4). This verse speaks against gambling because those who gamble do not please the Lord, but instead risk their wealth in a vain attempt to acquire more.

The New Testament also condemns gambling. In 1 Timothy 6:10, Paul says that “the love of money is the root of all evil.” Gambling inevitably leads to covetousness and greed, which are two of the seven deadly sins.

Gambling is also harmful to society as a whole. It promotes recklessness and irresponsible spending, and can lead to financial ruin for both individuals and families. It also creates addiction problems for many people.

There is no justification for gambling, based on the Bible. It is a sinful activity that harms individuals and society as a whole.

#  The Bible offers no clear perspective on gambling, but it is likely not encouraged

The Bible does not specifically mention gambling, but there are verses which suggest that it is not likely to be endorsed by God. Gambling can be seen as a form of greed, and the Bible says that "the love of money is the root of all evil" (1 Timothy 6:10). In addition, gambling can lead to excessive risk-taking, and the Bible warns against taking unnecessary risks (Proverbs 13:16).

There are also biblical principles which suggest that gambling is morally wrong. One such principle is that people should not profit from others' misfortune (Proverbs 17:5). Gambling takes advantage of people who are hoping to win money, and it often results in them losing more than they originally bet.

While the Bible does not say definitively whether or not gambling is okay, the evidence seems to suggest that it is not encouraged. Those who gamble should be aware of the risks involved, and they should also be mindful of the principles outlined in Scripture which suggest that gambling is morally wrong.
