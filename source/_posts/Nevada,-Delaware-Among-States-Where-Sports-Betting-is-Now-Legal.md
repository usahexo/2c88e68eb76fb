#  Nevada, Delaware Among States Where Sports Betting is Now Legal

On Monday, the US Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal law that had prohibited most states from authorizing sports betting.

This means that individual states are now free to decide whether or not to allow sports gambling within their borders.

As of Wednesday, May 16, 2018, at least six states had already moved to legalize some form of sports betting.

These states are Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Mississippi.

In addition, Illinois is considering a bill to legalize sports gambling, and Rhode Island has already authorized a state-run sports lottery.

#  Three More States Approve Sports Betting, Joining Nevada and Delaware

On Monday, May 14th, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), a 1992 federal law that effectively prohibited sports gambling across most of the country. The decision clears the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders.

Just days after the ruling, Delaware became the second state to offer legal sports betting, followed by Nevada and then New Jersey. West Virginia and Mississippi are expected to join them soon.

How will this change gambling in America?

For starters, it could mean a big boost in revenue for states that decide to legalize sports betting. In New Jersey alone, analysts estimate that legalizing sports betting could net the state $120 million in annual tax revenue.

It could also lead to increased tourism, as people travel to states where they can bet on sports legally. In fact, one study showed that if Delaware were to offer single game wagering (betting on individual games), it could bring in an additional $9 million in revenue from out-of-state visitors.

Legalized sports betting will also create new jobs in the gambling industry. For example, Delaware is expected to hire about 150 people to work in its casinos and racinos once sports betting is up and running.

What does this mean for fans?

For fans of professional and college sports, legalized sports betting could mean a whole new level of excitement. Instead of just rooting for their favorite team or player, they'll be able to place bets on the outcomes of games and potentially make some money while they're at it!

Sports betting already occurs illegally throughout much of the country, so many fans are likely excited about the prospect of doing it legally and with a bit more protection. After all, regulated sports gambling offers consumer protections that illegal gambling does not, such as age limits and prohibitions on insider trading.

How will this impact sports organizations?

Sports organizations have long been opposed to legalized sports gambling, arguing that it could compromise the integrity of their games. However, with PASPA now overturned, they can no longer use federal law as an excuse to avoid dealing with it.

Now that legalization is becoming more widespread, sports organizations will likely need to come up with ways to deal with potential corruption issues head-on. They may need to put into place stricter regulations governing how athletes can bet on games and how information about those bets can be shared among teams and other officials.

#  Illinois Moves Closer to Legalizing Sports Betting

The state of Illinois is one step closer to legalizing sports betting.

The Illinois Senate approved a bill on Wednesday that would legalize sports betting in the state. The bill now moves to the Illinois House for consideration.

If the bill becomes law, Illinois would join a growing number of states that have legalized sports betting in recent months.

Supporters of the bill say that it could generate up to $200 million in annual revenue for the state. They argue that the money could be used to help fund public schools and other government programs.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction and other social problems. They also say that it could damage the integrity of sporting events.

Whether or not the bill becomes law, it is clear that there is growing momentum nationwide for legalizing sports betting.

#  Sports Betting Legislation Gaining Momentum in US States

As the legalization of sports betting picks up steam in the US, more and more states are beginning to introduce bills that would allow for it.

The movement towards legalized sports betting has been gaining traction since the US Supreme Court struck down a law banning it in May of 2018. Now, lawmakers in over a dozen states are working on bills to legalize the industry.

Supporters of legalized sports betting say that it would bring much needed revenue to states,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) as well as create jobs. They also argue that it would be a boon to tourism, and that it would help to regulate an industry that is currently rife with corruption.

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to addiction problems for people who engage in it, and that it could also increase crime rates. They also warn that the legalization of sports betting could pave the way for other forms of gambling to be legalized as well.

So far, Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey and West Virginia have already legalized sports betting, with more states likely to follow suit in the coming months and years.

#  Could Online Sports Betting be Legalized in Your State?

Could online sports betting be legalized in your state? If you're like most Americans, the answer is probably no. But if you happen to live in New Jersey, Delaware, Nevada or Pennsylvania, the answer is a definite yes.

All four states currently offer some form of legal online sports betting. And with more and more states looking to cash in on this growing industry, it's only a matter of time before online sports betting becomes legal nationwide.

So what's driving this trend towards legalized online sports betting? The simple answer is money. States see online sports betting as a great way to generate tax revenue and create jobs. And with millions of Americans already engaging in illegal sports betting, there's a lot of potential revenue to be had.

But not everyone is on board with legalizing online sports betting. Some people argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other social problems. Others worry that it could have a negative impact on the integrity of sporting events.

Despite these concerns, the trend towards legalized online sports betting seems likely to continue. So if you're interested in placing a wager on the big game, you might want to check out one of the states that currently offers legal online sports betting.
