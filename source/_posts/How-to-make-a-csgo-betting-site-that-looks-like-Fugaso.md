#  How to make a fake Fugaso csgo betting site in minutes!

In this tutorial, we are going to show you how to make a fake Fugaso csgo betting site in minutes! This is a great way to prank your friends, or just make a joke site for kicks. Let's get started!

First, we need to create a new directory for our project. We can do this by running the following command in terminal:

mkdir fugaso-csgo-betting-site

 cd fugaso-csgo-betting-site/

Now that we have created our project directory, we need to create a file called "index.html". We can do this by running the following command:

nano index.html

Now, let's add the following HTML code to our file:

<html>
 <head> <title>Fugaso CSGO Betting Site</title> </head> <body> <h1>Welcome to the Fugaso CSGO Betting Site!</h1> <form action="https://www.fugaso.com/csgobet/" method="post"> <p><input type="hidden" name="token" value="" /></p> <input type="text" name="username" /> <input type="password" name="password" /> <input type="text" name=" skins " /> Amount of skins to bet:<br/>           1=1$ | 5=5$ | 10=10$ etc.<br/>  <button type="submit">Submit</button> </form> </body> </html>
The above code will create a simple form that allows users to input their username, password, and the amount of skins they would like to bet. When they press the "submit" button, it will send them over to the Fugaso website. Now, let's add some CSS code so that our form looks nicer:

					style>.form-group { padding: 0px 3px; }

#username { margin-top: 5px; }	#password { margin-top: 5px; }	#amount { margin-top: 5px; } input[type='text']{ width: 100%; font-size: 16px; border: 1px solid #dcdcdc; } button{ background:#4CAF50; color:#fff; border-radius: 4px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 26px; text-transform: uppercase; cursor: pointer;} </style></head><body id='fugaso'>

.<h1 id='header'>Fugaso CSGO Betting Site</h1><div class='row'>

.<form action='https://www.fugaso.com/csgobet/' method='post'> .<div class='form-group col-md-12'> .<label for='username'>Username</label>:<input type='text' id='username' name='username' value=''/> </div><div class='form-group col-md-12'> .<label for='password'>Password</label>:<input type='password' id='password' name='password' value=''/> </div><div class='form-group col-md-'><label for='amount'>Skins Amount</label>:<input type=”text” id=’amount’ name=’amount’ value=’0′ autocomplete= »on«/> $ </div><button type = »submit » class = »btn btn - primary « >Submit</button></form><!-- / row --> </div></body></html>
